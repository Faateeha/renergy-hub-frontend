          The Business Case for Alternative Energy
        </h3>
        <p className="text-justify text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Alternative energy sources, such as solar, wind, and geothermal power,
          are clean, renewable, and increasingly accessible. Unlike traditional
          fossil fuels, they produce minimal environmental impact, making them
          essential for businesses committed to sustainability. Incorporating
          alternative energy into business operations signals a commitment to
          environmental stewardship, appealing to eco-conscious consumers,
          investors, and partners. Moreover, it positions businesses as
